# Rock API 
#### The best Rock API


### What is Rock API?
Rock API is an API that allows you to view rocks and find the ratings on them. However, this isn't a regular "rock finding" API... We have rocks like, `crunchy rock`, `moonrock`, and MANY more. This api we made for entertainment purposes. Use this API in your Discord bot for commands like `pls rock` or `!randomrock`. Use it in your website for... something. 


### How do I use Rock API?

URL = `https://mrconos.pythonanywhere.com/rock/<rock name>` - Gives you a rock which returns a name, desc, image (link or none), and rating. The rating is supposed to be out of 5.

Random URL = `https://mrconos.pythonanywhere.com/rock/random` - Gives you a random rock from the API.

View the `tests` folder for more examples.
